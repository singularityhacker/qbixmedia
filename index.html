			<h1 class="firstword" >About</h1>
            
			<p>My name is Justice G&ouml;del Conder and I started Qbix Media in 2009. Qbix Media started out as a domain reseller and hosting service but quickly grew to encompass many other Internet and tech oriented projects and services. The company's primary focus now is threefold: consultation, front-end web development, and advertising. In addition to my own expertise, Qbix Media relies on a network of technical professionals to provide its clients with the most accurate and up-to-date information and services related to emerging technologies.</p>
                        
            <h1 class="firstword">Services</h1>
            
            <p>As a company, Qbix Media prides its self in the rapid development of cutting edge deliverables that require little to no overhead costs. The rate of technological change is accelerating at exponential proportions and many large corporate environments are finding it impossible to keep up. This is where Qbix Media finds its greatest strength. We are a company of sprinters in a market of sleeping giants. Take a few minutes to peruse some Qbix Media projects.</p>
